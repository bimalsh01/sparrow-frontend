## Features

### Admin Role

## Technologies

- **React.js:** Core frontend library
- **Redux:** State management
- **Bootstrap:** UI styling

## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend via a RESTful API, handling operations for both Admin and User roles, such as room management, bookings, and customer data.

## Future Works

- **Mobile Optimization:** Enhance responsiveness and usability on mobile devices.
- **Multi-Language Support:** Add support for multiple languages to cater to a diverse user base.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Integrate advanced analytics for admins to monitor booking trends, occupancy rates, and customer demographics.
- **Chat Support:** Implement a live chat feature for users to communicate with hotel staff.

## Challenges

- **State Management:** Handling complex state logic across multiple user roles (Admin and User) was challenging but manageable with Redux.
- **API Integration:** Ensuring smooth and secure API communication, especially with sensitive data like customer information and payments, required careful planning and testing.
- **Responsive Design:** Maintaining a consistent and user-friendly interface across different screen sizes was challenging but achieved through Bootstrap.
